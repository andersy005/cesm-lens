# cesm-lens
some templates for accessing analyzing the CESM large ensemble on NCAR's casper cluster

I have provided a conda environment to help avoid package mismatch:

Create the environment with:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Then you should hopefully have **lens-py** available as an environment in JupyterHub
